In midisplitter.py, I parse MIDI songs using the music21 library, and split them into separated parts, for example bass track, guitar track, etc.

In midivisualization.py, I parse MIDI songs, encode them into numbers, and plot them.

In output_to_midi.py, I convert numbers back into MIDI parts.

In markov_chain_baseline.py, I construct a Markov-chain.
