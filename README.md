# DeepLearningMusicGeneration
The project has 2 main parts:  
- Trying to generate Iron Maiden music from MIDI files  
- Trying to generate Classical music from continuous waveforms, such as mp3.  

I am going to use deep learning for the generation process, and because waveform and MIDI files differ from each other, I am storing them in different folders, like they are 2 separate projects.
